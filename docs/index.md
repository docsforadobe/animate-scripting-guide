# Adobe Animate Scripting Guide

Welcome to the Adobe Animate Scripting Guide!

This is a living document, and is constantly being updated and edited. The latest public version of the SDK is available at: [https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/animate.html](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/animate.html)

While we've tried to organize this document in a logical order and provide plenty of cross references, your specific needs may vary. Searching through this document based on keywords will often lead you to your answer.

If you need more information, your question may already be answered on the Animate forum: [Animate Forum](https://community.adobe.com/t5/animate/bd-p/animate?page=1&sort=latest_replies&filter=all)

Use the search box there, and post a new question if your question hasn't already been answered.
